Hi Orgad,
Long time no see. How's everything there?
Remember you provided a file "fail-mbr.bin" for DRBL/Clonezilla project?
Now we are working with a Debian developer, Georges Khaznadar,  to
package them. Georges suggested that we make sure this file's license.
Could you please let me know the license of the file "fail-mbr.bin" you
have created? GPL? BSD? Or?
We need to make sure it's compatible with DRBL/Clonezilla so that we can
include that in Debian's repository.
Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Steven.
